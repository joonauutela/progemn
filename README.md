## Installation

### Server

Go to 'server'-folder as your current working directory.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies.

```
npm install
```

Before starting the server you need to create a MongoDB-cluster
on https://www.mongodb.com/. After creating the cluster, create an '.env' file in root of server.

.env-file should look the following (the secret key can have any value):
```
MONGODB_URI=<your mongodb-URI here>
SECRET_KEY=<your secret key>
```

Start the server with nodemon.
```
npm run start
```

Start the server without nodemon.
```
npm run serve
```

Both commands start the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

### Client

Go to 'client'-folder as your current working directory.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
